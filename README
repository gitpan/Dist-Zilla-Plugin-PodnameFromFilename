NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodnameFromFilename - Fill out # PODNAME from
    filename

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodnameFromFilename (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-PodnameFromFilename), released on 2014-12-14.

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

     [PodnameFromFilename]

    In your module/script:

     # PODNAME:

    During build, PODNAME will be filled from filename. If Abstract is
    already filled, will leave it alone.

DESCRIPTION
    It's yet another DRY plugin. It's annoying that in scripts like
    "bin/some-progname" you have to specify:

     # PODNAME: some-progname

    With this plugin, the value of PODNAME directive will be filled from
    filename.
